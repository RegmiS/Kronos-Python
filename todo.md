## Todo list

in progress
- Implement queue based system 2nd queue linking on the side
- implement sorting algo that sorts the queue based on the weighting algorithmn
- make the weighting algorithmn
- figure out what gui i want to use to display the queue
- find some way to save tasks locally to computer (i.e. - creating tasks that need to get done, w/ habitual tasks that get updated and placed at the queue in certain spots)
- interactavity with the queue (ex - you decide to start a certain task right now instead of later - so the task is moved ahead of schedule, a note is made that the task was doneat a certain time and you keep going forward)
- viewer - a program that loads all the data so that you can view it in a easy to understand way. probably import and use matplotlib or some other program so that I can see how tasks are being completed and when they're being started/finished, etc
- task list so that you can update what tasks trigger other queued events (ex - computer triggers stretching every hour or when the event ends. stretch gets put into cooldown until either the task has been finished and it gets reset once it has been an hour (aka, it keeps task of the current cooldown if the task has been ongoing))
